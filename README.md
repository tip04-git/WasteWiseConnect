# WasteWiseConnect
"A machine learning-powered waste segregation model for efficient and eco-friendly waste management."

. Introduction:
    "Existing waste management systems struggle with ineffective waste segregation, resulting in environmental degradation and a lack of sustainable energy solutions. Our        goal is to develop a machine learning model that not only efficiently segregates waste but also identifies organic materials suitable for bioenergy generation.”

. Tech Stack:
    For this ML Model we have used “YOLOV5”.
    data set was taken from “Roboflow”.
    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: PyTorch, OpenCV
    
. Model Testing Result:

.Future Scalability:
  For any model the key aspects to consider are accuracy ,scalability ,reliability and security. To ensure these we follow :
  1. Implementing reinforcement learning in the image recognition models .
  2.Implementing fail-safes and regular maintenance schedules for hardware
    components.
  3.Securing the data transmission and storage to protect sensitive information.
  4.Taking the feedback from the end users and make necessary changes to the
    mode
