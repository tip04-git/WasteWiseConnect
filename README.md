# ♻️ WasteWiseConnect – ML-Powered Waste Segregation System

**WasteWiseConnect** is a machine learning–powered image classification system designed to automate waste segregation at the source — whether in homes or industrial yards — promoting environmental sustainability and efficient bioenergy generation.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Traditional waste management systems often fail at effective segregation, leading to:
- Environmental degradation
- Inefficient recycling
- Missed opportunities for sustainable energy extraction

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built a **YOLOv5-based image recognition model** that:
- Accepts user-submitted images of waste
- Classifies waste into types (organic, recyclable, hazardous, etc.)
- Enables early-stage segregation to reduce manual labor and improve processing efficiency

📸 This solution can be deployed at:
- **Household level** (smart bins or mobile apps)
- **Municipal dumping yards** for industrial automation

## 🚀 Future Scalability

To ensure long-term performance, our roadmap includes:
- ✅ **Reinforcement Learning** to improve accuracy from real-time feedback
- 🔐 **Secure transmission** of data (IoT-to-cloud) to protect user and system information
- 🛠 **Fail-safes for hardware deployments** (e.g., smart bins, smart sorting belts)
- 🔁 **User feedback loop** for adaptive learning and continuous model updates
