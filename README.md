# WasteWiseConnect
"A machine learning-powered waste segregation model for efficient and eco-friendly waste management."

**Introduction:**  
"Existing waste management systems struggle with ineffective waste segregation, resulting in environmental degradation and a lack of sustainable energy solutions. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that not only efficiently segregates waste but also identifies organic materials suitable for bioenergy generation.‚Äù

**Tech Stack:**  
We have used the following tech stack while developing:  
- **ML Model**: YOLOv5  
- **Dataset**: Roboflow  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, OpenCV  

**Model Testing Result:**

**Future Scalability:**  
For any model, the key aspects to consider are accuracy, scalability, reliability, and security. To ensure these, we follow:  
- Implementing reinforcement learning in the image recognition models.  
- Implementing fail-safes and regular maintenance schedules for hardware components.  
- Securing the data transmission and storage to protect sensitive information.  
- Taking feedback from end users and making necessary changes to the model.
