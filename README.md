# WasteWiseConnect
"A machine learning-powered waste segregation model for efficient and eco-friendly waste management."

>> Introduction:
Existing waste management systems struggle with ineffective waste
segregation, resulting in environmental degradation and a lack of
sustainable energy solutions. Our goal is to develop a machine
learning model that not only efficiently segregates waste but also
identifies organic materials suitable for bioenergy generation.”
>> Tech Stack:
For this ML Model we have used “YOLOV5”. The
data set was taken from “Roboflow”.
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV
