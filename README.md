# ♻️ WasteWiseConnect – ML-Powered Waste Segregation System

**WasteWiseConnect** is a machine learning–powered image classification system designed to automate waste segregation at the source — whether in homes or industrial yards — promoting environmental sustainability and efficient bioenergy generation.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Traditional waste management systems often fail at effective segregation, leading to:
- Environmental degradation
- Inefficient recycling
- Missed opportunities for sustainable energy extraction

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built a **YOLOv5-based image recognition model** that:
- Accepts user-submitted images of waste
- Classifies waste into types (organic, recyclable, hazardous, etc.)
- Enables early-stage segregation to reduce manual labor and improve processing efficiency

📸 This solution can be deployed at:
- **Household level** (smart bins or mobile apps)
- **Municipal dumping yards** for industrial automation

# WasteWiseConnect
"A machine learning-powered waste segregation model for efficient and eco-friendly waste management."

**Introduction:**  
"Existing waste management systems struggle with ineffective waste segregation, resulting in environmental degradation and a lack of sustainable energy solutions. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that not only efficiently segregates waste but also identifies organic materials suitable for bioenergy generation.”

**Our Solution:**
We created an ML model, that takes the picture of the waste from the user and analyse the type of waste it is,by doing this we can seperate the waste at the basic level itself. This tech can be used either in the dumping yards or in the homes which will simplify the process of waste segregation and man power.

**Tech Stack:**  
We have used the following tech stack while developing:  
- **ML Model**: YOLOv5  
- **Dataset**: Roboflow  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, OpenCV  

**Model Testing Result:**

**Future Scalability:**  
For any model, the key aspects to consider are accuracy, scalability, reliability, and security. To ensure these, we follow:  
- Implementing reinforcement learning in the image recognition models.  
- Implementing fail-safes and regular maintenance schedules for hardware components.  
- Securing the data transmission and storage to protect sensitive information.  
- Taking feedback from end users and making necessary changes to the model.
